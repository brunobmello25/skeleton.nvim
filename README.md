# skeleton.nvim

My personal neovim config.

Old and deprecated config is in my dotfiles repo: http://github.com/brunobmello25/dotfiles

## TODO

- [x] Setup packer autoclone and sync
- [x] Prevent packer from syncing every time I open neovim
- [x] Basic keymaps and colorscheme (catppuccin)
- [x] Fuzzy finder for files and grep with telescope
- [x] LSP and autocompletion
- [x] Formatting
- [x] Smart commenting
- [ ] Debugger
- [x] Add installation guide in readme
- [ ] Git integration

Not necessarily in this order

# How to install

```bash
# backup your old configuration if you have any
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim_old

make install
```
