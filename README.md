# skeleton.nvim

My personal neovim config.

"Why skeleton?"

Because I named it after I looked to a skull that I have on my shelve and thought it sounded cool.

## TODO

- [ ] Configure mason to recognize lsp by filetype and suggest autoinstall
- [ ] configure node debugger to attach to a docker container

# How to install

Run the following command

```bash
git clone git@github.com:brunobmello25/skeleton.nvim.git && \
cd skeleton.nvim && \
chmod +x ./install.sh && \
./install.sh
```
