# skeleton.nvim

My personal neovim config.

"Why skeleton?"

Because I named it after I looked to a skull that I have on my shelve and thought it sounded cool.

## TODO

- [ ] Configure mason to recognize lsp by filetype and suggest autoinstall
- [ ] configure node debugger to attach to a docker container

# How to install

```bash
# backup your old configuration if you have any
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim_old

make install
```
