# skeleton.nvim

My personal neovim config.

"Why skeleton?"

Because I named it after I looked to a skull that I have on my shelve and thought it sounded cool.

# How to install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:brunobmello25/skeleton.nvim.git # Clone it

cd skeleton.nvim # cd into it

./install.sh # run install script
