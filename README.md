# skeleton.nvim

My personal neovim config.

Original (and current) config is in my dotfiles repo: http://github.com/brunobmello25/dotfiles

## TODO

- [x] Setup packer autoclone and sync
- [ ] Prevent packer from syncing every time I open neovim
- [ ] Basic keymaps and colorscheme (catppuccin)
- [ ] Fuzzy finder for files and grep with telescope
- [ ] LSP and autocompletion
- [ ] Formatting
- [ ] Smart commenting
- [ ] Debugger

Not necessarily in this order
